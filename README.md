# STL-PI Motion Planner

This repository contains the code for the STL-PI Motion Planner, a novel approach to solving optimal control problems using Signal Temporal Logic (STL) cost functions.

## Paper Submission

Our paper on the STL-PI Motion Planner has been submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025. We will make the full code and documentation publicly available here after the paper is accepted.

## Coming Soon

Stay tuned for updates! The code and additional resources will be released upon acceptance of the paper.
